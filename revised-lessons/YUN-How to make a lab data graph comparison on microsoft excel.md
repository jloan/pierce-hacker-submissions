## Lesson Objectives/Outcomes
1. Student will be able to set up a chart.
1. Student will be able to insert sets of data into a chart.
1. Student will be able to label data.
1. Student will be able to compare sets of data.

Microsoft Excel and a Microsoft Excel compatible device.


## Lesson Steps/Components
### Step one:  Fill the excel sheet with your data.

### Step Three: Click "Chart Design", then click "Select Data". Type first group name (Metal A) after "Name", and delete all information in "X values" and "Y values", then, Highlight your data by moving the mouse from the beginning of your data to the end of your data to the "X values" or "Y values". Loook about the picture steps in the following.

### To add more sets of data, just click "+" button under the Legend entries(Series), Then do the same steps as Metal A.

### Step Five:Click one dot of data on Metal A, then click "Add Trendline". Then, click the Trendline Option you like. I circled "linear", "Display Equation on Chart" and "Display R-squared value" on chart". Click any circle bottons upon your personal desires.

## Conclusion
Microsoft Excel offers many chart types to illustrate two data series in a visually interesting way. The "insert" tab on the command ribbon includes a Charts group with different types of chart like "Pie", "Bar" and "Surface". The example I used is a Liner Graph, Which I used mostly for Chemistry Lab. I hope that this tutorial has helped to demonstrate the general guidelines to create a data graph with microsoft excel.
