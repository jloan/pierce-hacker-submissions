 The Educational Planner is a planning tool that allows students and advisors to communicate in forming an academic path.

The classes in your degree plan are easily rearranged (if a class fills up and you’re unable to take it that quarter you can move on to plan B and move the full class over). You also have the option to copy the plan if you want to look try out different options. Additionally, you can share your plan with your advisor for quality checking.
