## Tips for Building a Professional Résumé
----------------------
1. Résumé Layout:
 The layout is the first thing to affect the reader because it’s the first thing the brain processes—before even the text or texture is noticed. This makes the résumé's layout vital to survive the screening process.
>a. Templates:
- Although it may be tempting to simply utilize one of or multiple résumé templates from Microsoft Word or from outside sources, these can often be misinterpreted as a lack of effort from the candidate in the eyes of the recruiters.
- It is still possible to utilize these templates as guides, but it is not advised to use the templates fully.
>b. Alignment:
- The résumé should always be in left alignment as this is the easiest for the reader to digest.This includes all headings and bulleted lists.
- The exceptions to this rule are the author's name and contact information, as these can be center or left aligned depending on the layout chosen by the student.
>c. Length:
- A professional résumé should be one-page in length. One-page résumés are focused, concise, and uncomplicated, which is what employers hope to see in résumés. 
- If your résumé is longer than one-page, review the material and considere which elements are the most relevant to the reader.
>d. Margin:
- One-inch margins are the most frequently used and recommended dimensions for a résumé.
- If your résumé is slightly longer than one-page in length, consider changing the margins to 1/2 inch size as this is also acceptable. 
- Do not create margins to be wider than this as it may leave too much "white space" within the résumé giving the appearance of a lack of content.

2. Résumé Fonts:
>a. Font Styles: 
- The chosen font style is dependent on the student's preferance; however, the goal should be to present the material in a professional manner. 
- With this in mind, *Arial* and *Times New Roman* font styles are generally accepted professional fonts and, thus, is the safest options when writing a résumé.
>b. Font Size:
- Résumé font size should be linked directly to font style but usually between 11 and 12 point font.
>c. Font Color:
- If students choose to use color, it should be a primary color, and it should be muted—no bright neon! Simple and subtle reigns supreme in the résumé world.
- The key with color in résumés is retaining the focus on the words rather than moving the reader’s focus to colors. Colors on résumés are meant to help convey information, not hinder it.

3. General Advice:
>a. Content:
- When choosing what content to place into your résumé, the goal should be to demonstrate your best abilities, strengths, and experience to stand apart from the other candidates. 
- The general content headers for most résumés would include *Possessed Skills*, *Education*, *Prior Work Experience*, and *Certifications* in no particular order. 
- The order for this content can be adjusted depending on its relevance to the specific job or school being applied for.
>b. Renewals:
- Few candidates are willing to update or edit their résumé when applying for new jobs on a regular basis. This is often noted by recruiters who can perceive whether a résumé was written for them or for recruiters in general.
- It is advised that your résumé be renewed for every job that you apply for in order to maintain relevance to the recruiters who are reading the résumé. This is another great way to help your résumé stand out from the others in the pile.
